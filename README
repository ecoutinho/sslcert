trivial openssl config file that allows you to create certificat
signing requests or self signed certificates without asking
questions. By default the certificate uses the value of $HOSTNAME as
CN and subject alternative name of type DNS. This is all you need
for host certificates.

to generate self signed certificate (replace 666 with the number of
days you want the cert to be valid):

$ openssl req -config openssl.cnf -new -text -x509 -days 666 -out $HOSTNAME.pem

to generate a certificate signing request:

$ openssl req -config openssl.cnf -new -text -keyout $HOSTNAME.key -out $HOSTNAME.req
